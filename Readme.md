♣️ Blackjack Game

A frontend-only interactive Blackjack game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

📌 Overview

This Blackjack Game is a simple, browser-based implementation of the classic card game. It was built as a learning project to deepen understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, game logic, and state management using pure front-end tools—no frameworks, libraries, or backend services.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate clean UI design, maintainable JavaScript, and thoughtful handling of game mechanics such as hit logic, dealer behavior, and win/loss detection.
